<p>so im like a kid who is atutic and pretty weroid in everyway. but its fine i just act like a normal kid anyway but with a twist of a unbeatable imagiogation and yeah its fun to use use it a lot everyday and ect. but i like pokemon,magic the gathering,video games ECT. and i would like to have fun a lot while i work and imagion that i do it while i dot. but my school life is pretty normal i just try to stay in the dark and advoid any choas and fights but i someone made the first move then he or she is going down to the underworld. but rather than that im pretty chill most of the time i have good grades most of the time and i want to keep it that way for as long as possible and land a good job and get into a collage ECT. but i dont know why people or some of my friends call me the swearing inocent bean i dont know why but i think its funny because i dont know anything when it comes to the weroid stuff </p>
